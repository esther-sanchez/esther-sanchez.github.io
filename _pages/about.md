Welcome! I am Esther Sanchez, a PhD student in the Joint PhD program in Public Policy and Economics between the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and the Department of Economics. I am interested in informal economies, the political economy of crime, and survey methods in economics.

Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for Dr. Matthew Notowidigdo. I received a BA in Political Science from the University of Kentucky in 2020.
