Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Joint Public Policy and Economics program at the University of Michigan. My research interests include informal economies, the political economy of crime, and survey methods in applied economics.

Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business for Dr. Matthew Notowidigdo. I received a BA in Political Science from the University of Kentucky in 2020.
